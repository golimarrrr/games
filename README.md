## wappo.lsp

Lisp program that solves any level of the game Wappo (http://www.softexdigital.com/wappo.htm). Itâ€™s a J2ME game that came with Siemens mobile phones.

You have to code the layout of the level you want to solve. At the end of the program you can see the example for the first three levels of the game. You have to enter the starting coordinates of Wappo, one or more Yumchaks (the enemies), the pits, the walls (in this case you enter the coordinates of the two tiles that surround the wall), and the exit.

It will print the sequence of moves you have to make. Tested only with CLISP for Windows
